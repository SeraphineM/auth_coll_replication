# Replication files 

In the folder above called "Replication, Garbe et al. 2025", you find all material needed to replicate the article 
"Authoritarian collaboration and repression in the digital age: 
Balancing foreign direct investment and control in internet infrastructure" published
in Democratization (https://doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2024.2442377).

Download the folder via the breen button `Code`, download zip. 

## All analyses are conducted in R and Quarto. Quarto is pre-installed in recent versions of RStudio. ##

For replicating the entire article including all tables and figures, 
you need to download the folder, open the Quarto file "Preprint.qmd" in RStudio, install all R packages
and render the document. Alternatively, you can also replicate single tables and figures 
by running the respective R code chunks included in the Quarto file.
The same applies to "Supplemental Material".
